##Ticnet
Machine learning intro project for high school students

##About
This project was created by Peter Hart for 18.0651: Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning.
Some of the code was borrowed from this artical: https://programmerbackpack.com/python-neural-network-tutorial/


This project was designed to let students easily set up and run the code in Google Collaboratory. 
The tutorial is intended as an introduction to working with neural networks with the Keras framework.


##Setup
1) Make a personal copy of this Colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YDlYyzTx-e8qXbuPdgRUDeyO298u2bOy?usp=sharing
2) Run the first cell to authorize colab to save the files to your google drive. This step is not necessary to run the code, but allows 
you to save modifications to the code, and any models that you train.
3) Run the second cell to pull the code from github.
4) Run the rest of the cells. Follow along with the documentation and experiment!
